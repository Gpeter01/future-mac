        <h1><em>Me</em>, telling the truth of the whole story</h1>
            <p>
            <strong><em>All is how to work bruv, start of as a worker and that is just how it works bruv. 
            The only pull up when they need something</em>, it pisses me the hell off.</strong>
            Let's just make it work for now, ok? That is just how it should work for now
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>I am telling y'all the truth really</em>. It is funny how things work lately.
            Let's just keep it real and stay happy, and make the people I care about happy.
            That's how I want it to be.
            </p>
            <p>Just the truth of the story, you know. Someone has got to tell the truth</p>
